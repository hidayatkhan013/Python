## Solution Attached thumbs up ! 
## Question # 1:
Create a function named convertOctalthat should take a decimal number input from user and
convert it into octal.
Note: No output formatting should be used.
Input:
372
Output:
Number in Octal: 564
Question # 2:
Take an input from a user that consists of numbers, letters (both upper case and lower case
letters), and symbols (@,#,$,^,&,*,%, etc.).
Create a function checkString() that counts the number of upper case letters, lower case letter,
symbols and numbers and prints them accordingly. 
Input:
@#bfjHDKA56^#@!0
Output:
Number of symbols: 6
Number of digits: 3
Number of Upper case letters: 4
Number of Lower case letters: 3
Question # 3:
Write a python program that takes a number from a user and prints all odds numbers less than
the input number. The printing for odd number should take place in a function named
oddNumbers.
Input:
31
Output:
Odd Numbers:1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29
Question # 4:
Write a python program that takes two positive integers from a user and calculates the Least
Common Multiple (LCM) of those two integers. The calculation should take place in a function
named checkLcm.
Input:
6
4
Output:
Least Common Multiple: 12
Question # 5:
Write a Python program takes two integers (a and b) and calculates the following:
 (a + b) 2 = a 2 + b 2 + 2ab.
 (a − b) 2 = a 2 + b 2 − 2ab.
 a
2 − b 2 = (a − b) (a + b)
For each formula, make a separate function and each function should be invoked after the
input has been taken from the user.
Input:
6
-6
Output:
The value of (a + b) 2
is: 0
The value of (a − b) 2
is: 144
The value of a 2 − b 2
is: 0

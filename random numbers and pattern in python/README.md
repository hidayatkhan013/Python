# Exercise 1

Write a procedure that generates n random numbers between 0 and 100, 
prints them, and computes and prints their average.

### ------------------------------
# Exercise 2
### ------------------------------

# Write a procedure that prints a diamond pattern of size n (see below).   
You may assume that n is always an odd number.  
Hint: you may want to experiment with the 'end' named parameter of the  
'print' built-in procedure. E.g.  

          print('*', end='')

prints a star, but does not move the current printing position to the next line.
